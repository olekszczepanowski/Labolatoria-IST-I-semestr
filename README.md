# Lab-IST-First-semester
Projects for coding labs.

This repo contains simple projects, where I've learned basics of Java. It's about fundamentals of Java, such as basic syntax, data structures, data types, conditionals, functions, loops, OOP, exception handling, serialization, collection, strategy and obsever desing pattern. 
Unfortunately, most of code is written in polish. Back then, it was easier to me to write in my native language.
